  <div id="whoami">
  As a Communications Major and Advertising and PR minor, I have had the privilege to develop a perspective on the world, and also learn to use that perspective to make a difference in my respective field.
  My previous work knowledge has allowed me to gain experience in customer service and I have come to learn that I am extremely passionate about one thing in particular-people.
  With the easy and outgoing personality I have, I find myself adapting well in new environments and find it simply enjoyable to meet new people.
  I am often seen as someone who is not afraid to go outside the box, which allows me to apply my imagination and creativity to my work and projects.
  I also pride myself in my ability to work under pressure and to meet deadlines without sacrificing the quality of my work.
